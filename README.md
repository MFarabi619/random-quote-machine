Hi!

This is static website that displays random quotes.

The IDE I'm using for development is VS Code with the following relevant extensions:

* Auto Rename Tag (Helps autocomplete html tags)
* Code Runner (Runs Javascript)
* Color Highlight (Makes the code colorful and thus easier to work with)
* Prettier Code Formatter (Formats the code to make it look neater)
* Quokka.js (Displays runtime values next to the line of code so that I don't have to run console.log as much)
* Vim (Allows use of Vim inside VS Code)
vscode-icons (Overhaul of default VS Code icons to improve development experience)

The goal(s) of this project will be as follows:

* Attain a better understanding of React, Redux, Bootstrap, and SaSS.
* Improve at making focused commits with detailed documentation to show progress of project.
* Use the GitHub Projects feature to break the project down to smaller, easily-achievable chunks.


Learning log:

* Was introduced to React hooks, and realized that they were far easier to work with than the class system taught in the current freeCodeCamp curriculum. 
* Learned and used some basic folder structure so that project could be easily scaled in the future
* Gained experience planning out the project, and breaking large tasks into smaller tasks, which made the project as a whole seem less daunting.
* Didn't end up using Redux at all and used React state hooks instead.
