# random-quote-machine
Hi!

I will be completing freeCodeCamp's Random Quote Machine project which is required for the completion of the Front End Development Libraries certification.

The IDE I'm using for development is VS Code with the following relevant extensions:

* Auto Rename Tag (Helps autocomplete html tags)
* Code Runner (Runs Javascript)
* Color Highlight (Makes the code colorful and thus easier to work with)
* Prettier Code Formatter (Formats the code to make it look neater)
* Quokka.js (Displays runtime values next to the line of code so that I don't have to run console.log as much)
* Vim (Allows use of Vim inside VS Code)
vscode-icons (Overhaul of default VS Code icons to improve development experience)

The goal(s) of this project will be as follows:

* Attain a better understanding of React, Redux, Bootstrap, and SaSS.
* Improve at making focused commits with detailed documentation to show progress of project.
* Use the GitHub Projects feature to break the project down to smaller, easily-achievable chunks.
